# Data Cleaning

This GitHub repository contains various files related to data cleaning techniques and methodologies. The repository aims to provide a comprehensive guide and examples for performing data cleaning using popular Python libraries such as Scikit-learn and Pandas. The following sections briefly describe the contents of each file:

## Data Cleaning using Scikit-learn

In this file, you will find an in-depth explanation of data cleaning techniques implemented using Scikit-learn. It covers topics such as handling missing values, imputing categorical data, and applying feature scaling, standardization, and normalization to enhance data quality.

## Data cleaning by Pandas

This file focuses on data cleaning techniques using the powerful Pandas library. It demonstrates how to handle missing values, remove duplicates, filter outliers, and perform other essential data cleaning tasks. The examples provided will help you gain proficiency in using Pandas for data cleaning purposes.

## Replace missing values by (Mean, Median & Mode)

Here, you will find an exploration of different approaches to replacing missing values in a dataset. The file showcases three common strategies: using the mean, median, and mode of the available data to fill in the gaps. You will learn when each strategy is most appropriate and how to implement them efficiently.

## Categorical Data Imputation

This file delves into imputation techniques specifically designed for categorical data. It explains how to handle missing values in categorical variables by assigning values based on various strategies, such as mode imputation, random sampling, or using machine learning algorithms like decision trees.

## Dummy Variables and One-Hot Encoding

In this file, you will learn about encoding categorical variables into numerical representations using dummy variables and one-hot encoding. The examples provided demonstrate how to convert categorical data into a format suitable for machine learning models that require numeric inputs.

## Feature Scaling / Standardization & Normalization

This file covers the importance of feature scaling, standardization, and normalization in data cleaning. It provides an overview of the differences between these techniques and demonstrates how to apply them effectively to ensure that features are on similar scales and distributions, ultimately improving the performance of machine learning models.

Feel free to explore the files in this repository to enhance your knowledge of data cleaning techniques and best practices.
